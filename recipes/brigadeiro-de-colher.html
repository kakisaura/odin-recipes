        <p>A brigadeiro (pronounced bɾiga'dejɾu) is a traditional Brazilian party dessert that is similar to a bonbon or fudge. Created in Rio de Janerio in the 1940s, brigadeiros' origin is tied to political campaigns of presidents and even the suffrage movement of Brazil. Today, brigadeiros continue to be one of the most popular desserts in Brazil for any occasion.</p>
        <p>Brigadeiros in Brazil are most commonly shaped into bonbon balls after cool-off and topped with chocolate chip sprinkles. You could also eat the fudge plain with a spoon</p>
